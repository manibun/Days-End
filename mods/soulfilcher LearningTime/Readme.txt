Soul Filcher's Learning Time mod
By Soul Filcher, 2019.
Downloaded from Steam Workshop.

This mod adds a series of complete guides that include all magazine recipes from each
subject. Players can use notebooks to make copies of all magazines or from parts of
a guide.

As a bonus there are written notes about the engineer bombs that don't have magazines.

Work in progress, so things may look unfinished and not work 100% as intended.
