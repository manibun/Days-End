description=When you play hydrocraft, the Crafting menu opens slowly and every time you craft something, it will get stuck.

This mod can solve the lag problem by reducing the time of updates.
But the bad thing is, the Crafting menu not as sensitive as before. You need to click on the recipe to update it.
