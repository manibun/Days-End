If you are reading this with the intention of improving this mod's support for this language, thank you.
Know that I will gladly work with you to have the mod be perfectly translated in all possible languages.

I recommend that you send me a friendship request on Steam and tell me that you want to help translate the mod.
Every time the mod is updated and there is need to edit these files, I will let you know, if possible.
Once I receive the files I will do my best to include them in the next update.

The header at the top will be crediting the users that have contributed with the files.
If the user mentioned is me, then it means I used online translators and dictionaries to the best of my abilities.
If you notice some of the translations are not up to par, I may have filled in the gaps using the method mentioned above.
