description=Something I found when playing Zomboid was that the Boredom moodle was always a bit frustrating to manage. The way it functions in vanilla, any time you are indoors you are slowly gaining boredom, and it is slightly slower while reading. If you are in multiplayer and speak in chat, this lowers it, along with handling for when NPCs are in the game you will lose boredom if you are around them. You also will gain boredom if you sit in a vehicle and are not moving, but lose it when you are moving. Finally, you lose boredom if you are not a structure, and if you are panicked (anything greater then 5 for the panic levels) it immediately just sets your boredom to 0.<LINE>

description=A recent update has added proper boredom to player-built structures! I'm hoping my bug report helped this. With Boredom Tweaks, the boredom is a good bit more manageable.<LINE>

description=If you are in any building, this is how boredom will work:<LINE>

description=- While doing nothing, you are slowly gaining boredom<LINE>
description=- If you are reading, this slows that gain down<LINE>
description=- If you do any Timed Action, you will lose boredom instead! This includes things like storing/retrieving items, working out, or preparing food. The only exception is reading - as I wished to keep things similar to vanilla. But anything that puts the timed progress bar above your head is generally a Timed Action! If you are currently doing something, I don't think you'd be bored, especially in a survival scenario!<LINE>
description=- If you are playing in multiplayer, and you are within five squares of another player, you will lose boredom! If someone is that close, you are probably hanging out and friends, or they are hostile and you probably will find it hard to be bored then!<LINE>
description=- The vanilla checks for speaking in chat as well as NPCs being around you are also preserved, and you will lose boredom if you do them as well! This should mean that once the future updates come out, it will be compatible - hopefully!<LINE>
description=- If you are in a vehicle, these same conditions also apply now as well!<LINE>
description=- Finally, if you are outdoors, you will constantly be losing boredom, and when you are panicked, you are still entirely unable to be bored.<LINE>

description=The biggest change I added with this mod: any time that you are losing boredom and you are practically at empty boredom levels (less then 5 while looking at the debug values), as long as you do not see the sadness moodle showing on the screen (less then 25), you will become happier slowly. If you are sad enough that it does show (greater then 25), then you will have to resort to other methods to get happier again. This has the effect of making it a bit easier to manage your boredom and mood together if you are being active, but if you go around doing things that will make you bored and sad, you still will have to manage that with other methods. Books and Comics are still important! These are personal little tweaks I found that makes it more enjoyable, and sensible too.<LINE>
