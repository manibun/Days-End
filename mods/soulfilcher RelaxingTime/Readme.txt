Soul Filcher's Relaxing Time mod
By Soul Filcher, 2020.
Downloaded from Steam Workshop.

This is mostly a mod for personal use, it adds several unused items found in Zomboid
files. It also adds variety to loot spawns for containers and zombies. As I keep
making additions and changes to this mod I may add more uses to existing items.

Work in progress, so things may look unfinished and not work 100% as intended.


-----ADDED ITEMS - LITERATURE-----------------------------------------------------

-Briefcase:         New container item.
-Coloring Book:     Requires crayons to be colored.
-Crosswords:        Requires a pen or pencil to be solved.
-Green Pen:         New color for notes.
-Magic 8-Ball:      Has the answers you seek, or maybe not.
-Multicolor Pen:    Enables all pen colors.
-Novel:             One more option to raise the mood. A little better than other
                    options but also a little harder to find.
